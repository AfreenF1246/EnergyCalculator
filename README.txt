This program is meant to be a prototype of an energy calculator,
it is meant to be enhanced over time.

A user is meant to use this so compare electricity rates and choose the best 
possible option for themselves. 

The unit of electrical energy is kWh, and is found by multiplying
the power use (kW) by the number of hours during which
the power is consumed. Multiply this value by the cost per kWh and 
you have the total energy cost. 

Included csv files: 
average.csv, profile.csv, solar.csv, competingRates.csv

These files are filled with dummy values and are meant to be 
placeholders until legitimate data is given. 
The values in the csv files are meant to be changed and 
updated per year to keep values as accurate as possible.

Steps to run:

To run make sure you have python and tkinter downloaded
All files should be in the same folder 
In terminal (or commandline) run main.py
